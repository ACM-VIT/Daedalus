## User Weightages

#### Calculating and assigning weightage after response

-

#### Calculating collective response

-

#### Maintaining user weightage and sensitivity

-

#### (A) Weightage Calculating and assigning

- Using deviation from the mean
    - Averaging out values will disregard quantity feature of the openion
    i.e. how many people feel the same effect
    - Outliers will need to be removed as they will generate a negative
    weight

- Using deviation form the median
    - Using median will take in to consideration the number of people having
    the same openion
    - Outliers will have to be reconsidered but this will again change the
    median

#### (B) Collective response calculation

- Weighted average method
  This is a great method and will give the best mean value as we consider
  the weight of someones openion
  Calculation of weights is a problem as these will have to be
  related to each other

#### (C) Maintaining user weightage and sensitivity

- If the mean or y value is calculated, then we must use the final
  next days value to compute the change in rating, also the user input
  must be used not generated values

- sensitivity in such a situation is a debatable factor, must discuss this
  in detail. Also a sensitivity based model will be heavily affected by
  the general openion
